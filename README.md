# About The Project

**VisitFlow** is a modern web application that simplifies the visit and order process between service providers (e.g. bosses) and customers. Customers receive a personal link which they can use to conveniently enter their address and a preferred appointment time. The boss sees these bookings in the calendar dashboard and can generate a PDF with order details after the on-site visit. This PDF is only released to the customer after successful payment (via Stripe).
